# Here is a very basic script to interpret.
#
# All commands must start at the beginning of the line.
# Anything not recognised is treated as a comment!

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   INTRODUCTION SCRIPT
#
## The following patch works on the script beginning 0x017bcb2c.
## This will read the dialogue, and automatically mark in addresses.
begin 0x017bcb2c

# Delete dialogue branch for Rif: That is without saying!
## Replace the address at the offset by a new address.
addr 0x017bce56 = 0x017bce58+12

## Seek the offset, and replace the next string.
## The string starts immediately after the colon, ie. " Kajishi!"
## Do NOT place comments after strings!
seek 0x017bcb5c: Kajishi!

## Seek and replace, but quote to retain trailing spaces.
seek 0x017bcb82:"  A title for one who has mastered  "

## Skip 4 characters (00 00 08 03), and replace the next string.
skip 4:"      the art of weapon craft       "

## Insert a sequence of raw characters followed by a string.
insert 0x00 0x00 0x08 0x03:"      and the way of the blade      "

## Seek the offset, skip forward 2 characters, and replace the next string.
## This is useful if the start of the string is in a compressed character.
seek 0x017bcbcc+2:"   To one who continually hones     "
skip 4:"his skills by forging and polishing "

## Delete 40 characters.
delete 40

# Ritchie and V.E

seek 0x017bced0:Their friend!
seek 0x017bcedb+14:Their strength!
seek 0x017bcee4+14:Their life!

# V.E
seek 0x017bcf40+4:Then,
skip 4:defeat me with your hammer!
seek 0x017bcf6f:That will be your ..
seek 0x017bcf8e:final test!

## The compressed script should end before 0x017bd14c.
## This will commit the above changes.
end 0x017bd14c
